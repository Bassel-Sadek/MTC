   * Important Note: the weights for Bay Area household and person records, in the "statewide final weights" files, are different than the weights in the previous section on Bay Area weights. The geography for Bay Area weights in the Bay Area files is at the PUMA level; in the California files, the minimum geography is Bay Area County. For Bay Area applications, use the "Bay Area" files.
