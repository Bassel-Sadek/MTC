The transit skimming procedure create skim tables for five time periods, three access/egress combinations, and six line-haul mode combinations. 

The five time periods are: (i) early AM, before 6 am; (ii) AM peak period, 6 am to 10 am; (iii) midday, 10 am to 3 pm; (iv) PM peak period, 3 pm to 7 pm; and (v) evening, after 7 pm. 

The three access/egress combinations are: (i) walk/transit/walk; (ii) drive/transit/walk; and (iii) walk/transit/drive. 

The six line-haul mode combinations are: (i) long-haul premium or commuter rail; (ii) medium-haul premium or heavy rail (BART) (iii) medium-haul basic or express bus; (iv) short-haul premium or light rail; (v) short-haul basic or local bus; and (vi) a generic transit path used to calculate accessibility.

Note that ferry is included in the short-haul premium or light rail line-haul options.  This was done to reduce the number of skims that need to be created.  Because light rail and ferry do not compete with each other, travelers in corridors with light rail are presented with the light rail choice and travelers in corridors with ferry are presented with the ferry choice. 

The procedure outputs a 16-table skim for each time-of-day, access/egress, and line-haul mode combination, containing the following:
